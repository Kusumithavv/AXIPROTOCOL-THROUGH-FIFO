-__AXI FIFO (axi_fifo.v)__  
    - This is the Top module instantiating read and write transaction channel from master to the slave.
-__AXI FIFO WRITE (axi_fifo_wr.v)__

                      bits of the write data bus.
                  -WLAST (MASTER TO SLAVE)

                       -This signal indicates that valid write data and strobes are available. 
                  -WREADY (SLAVE TO MASTER)
                       -This signal indicates that the slave can accept the write data
                       
            -WRITE RESPONSE CHANNEL:
                  -BID (SLAVE TO MASTER)
                       -The ID tag of the write response. 
                  -BRESP (SLAVE TO MASTER)
